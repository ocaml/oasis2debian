xstrp4 patching
===============

As of version 1.7, xstrp4 need to be patched to compile this project. Consider
applying the patch you can find in the top directory of this project:
xstrp4-record-v2.patch 

This patch gives the ability to camlp4 to use variable like "$rcrd.field".

It has been submitted upstream, and it will hopefully be integrated into xstrp4
v1.8.
